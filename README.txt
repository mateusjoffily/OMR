To use the Optical Mark Recognition Toolbox, you’ll need to edit the files below according to your project and run 'example_launcher' in Matlab: 

(1) example_launcher.m 
(2) example_ratings.m 

You can test those scripts with the image files available in the ./example folder without any change. 

To run the scripts with your own image files, you’ll need to :

(1) create a reference image: this is just the image of a blank form. 
(2) create a mask image: this is an image with dark blobs at the locations that should be filled in the form.
(3) place the image of each filled form in the same folder (e.g. '.\example\subjects'). 

The current version of OMR Toolbox was tested using Matlab R2007b in Win XP. Notice that Matlab Image Processing Toolbox is required.

Good luck!
